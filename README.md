This is the first game i made in pure C++ with the SFML graphics library. 
In this game you go around a 2D level collecting apples and growing with each item you pick up.
if the player hits themselves, they get cut at that point and lose a life.
If you run out of lives or hit a border, you lose and the game ends.
